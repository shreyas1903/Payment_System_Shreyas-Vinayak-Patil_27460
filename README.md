**Payment System GitHub Repository**

This repository contains the code for a Payment System application built using Angular and Spring Boot. The Payment System is a web application that allows users to make credit card payments, access exclusive offers and discounts, manage credit card bills, track expenses, and earn rewards points for paying bills on time. The application provides a convenient and centralized platform for users to handle and pay off all their credit card dues.

**Technologies Used**

The Payment System application is developed using the following technologies:

1. **Angular**: Angular is a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It provides a structured and component-based architecture, making it easy to create scalable and maintainable applications.

2. **HTML/CSS**: The application's user interface is created using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Custom styles have been applied to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used as the primary programming language for Angular applications. It adds static typing to JavaScript, making it easier to detect and fix errors during development.

4. **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a CSS framework that provides pre-designed UI components and styles. It is used to ensure a responsive and mobile-friendly design for the application.

5. **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to build server-side applications and perform various tasks in the development environment.

6. **Spring Boot**: Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java-based web applications. It provides a rapid development environment, dependency management, and various features to streamline the development process.

**Features**

The Payment System application includes the following key features:

1. User Authentication: Users can log in to the system using their credentials (username and password) to access their account.

2. Make Payment: Authenticated users can make credit card payments through the app, which includes the option to enter the bill amount and the bill deadline.

3. Bill Management: The application helps users manage their credit card bills, track expenses, and view details of past payments.
